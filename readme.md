# Colour Contrast checker
I needed something that would allow me to check the colour contrast ratios of lots of colours at once, so i made it

## Input
**Contrast ratio:** will expect either a float or an empty line (will then defult to 4.5)

**Hex List:** wither empty (will randomly generate 3 hex values) or a string that gets regexes to take the first 6 vales after every `#`
